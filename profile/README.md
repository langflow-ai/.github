## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are [Logspace AI](https://logspace.ai/), a team of ambitious data engineers and scientists aiming to *make custom data solutions powered by state-of-the-art technologies with pipelines that start from experimentation all the way up to deployment.*

We believe that the customer should be part of the project development at any moment. That's why our team tasks are always visible, one link per project.
